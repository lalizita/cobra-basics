# Cobra Basics

Repo to apply my [Cobra CLI](https://cobra.dev/) studies.

### Todo App

I'm applying my studies building a todo app. The app should list all the tasks registered in a json file (internal/todo/todos.json).

To run this project you must have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed in your computer.

### List todos
```shell
make list
```
